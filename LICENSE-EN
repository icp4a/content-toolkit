IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs

2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.

LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (Z125-5543-05) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):

IBM Cloud Pak for Automation 20.0.3 SR1 (Evaluation)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Evaluation Period

The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 30 days.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Multi-Product Install Image

The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program (and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of the other software included in the image unless Licensee has acquired separate entitlements for that other software.

Bundled Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Bundled Programs identified below. A Bundled Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Bundled Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Bundled Program's terms. The Principal Program and any Bundled Programs are all part of the Program, as a whole. Therefore, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Bundled Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Bundled Program on a 10 VPC machine and another Bundled Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Concurrent Connection

Concurrent Connection is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Concurrent Connection is a simultaneous link or association of a database, application, server, or any other type of device which has been or is made available to the Program. Licensee must obtain entitlements for the total number of Concurrent Connections, which have been or are made to the Program.

Concurrent User

Concurrent User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Concurrent User is a person who is accessing the Program at any particular point in time. Regardless of whether the person is simultaneously accessing the Program multiple times, the person counts only as a single Concurrent User. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers, but Licensee must obtain entitlements for the maximum number of Concurrent Users simultaneously accessing the Program. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each simultaneous Concurrent User accessing the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means.

Install

Install is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Install is an installed copy of the Program on a physical or virtual disk made available to be executed on a computer. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each Install of the Program.

Process

Process is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Process is an instance of the Program being executed. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the total number of Processes executing at any point in time.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

Virtual Server

Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server made available to the Program, regardless of the number of processor cores in the virtual server or the number of copies of the Program on the virtual server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Infrequent User

Infrequent User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. Any Infrequent Users given access to the Program requires an entitlement. An Infrequent User is an Authorized User who accesses the Program not more than one hundred twenty (120) times in any consecutive 12 month period. A single access is comprised of one or more interactions between the Infrequent User and the Program or actions performed on behalf of the Infrequent User by the Program, all within a consecutive 15 minute period.

Licensee must track accesses by Infrequent Users to verify that they meet the access limitations of Infrequent Users. Licensee agrees to provide to IBM and its auditors details of the tracking mechanism described above, upon request.

Employee User

Employee User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Employee User is a unique person employed in Licensee's Enterprise, whether or not given access to the Program, or a unique person otherwise paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Employee User is unique to that Employee User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person. Licensee must acquire sufficient employee user entitlements to cover all employees and any other unique persons paid by or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise.

External User

External User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An External User is a unique person, not employed in, paid by, or acting on behalf of Licensee's Enterprise, who is given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. A person who is employed in or paid by Licensee's Enterprise, but is not accessing the Program within the scope of that relationship may be an External User. An entitlement for an External User is unique to that External User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the entitlement to another person.

Supporting Program Details

IBM DB2 Standard Edition

- Entitlement: No Metric

- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"No Metric" means this Supporting Program may be installed on as many machines and used by as many persons as is reasonably necessary within the use limitations that apply to this Supporting Program.

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration.

Additional IBM DB2 Standard Edition Details

The Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory on each physical or virtual server; however, if the Supporting Program is used on a cluster of servers configured to work together using database partitioning or other permitted clustering technology, the Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory across all virtual or physical servers in that cluster.
